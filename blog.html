        <h1>First day at Ada</h1>

        <p>Today was pretty chill and a little exhausting to be in zoom calls all day. Everyone is very encouraging and I feel so hopeful and confident that I'll be successful through the program, at least at this moment. I was able to "meet" other students. I think being remote won't be nearly as bad as I thought it would be.</p>

        <p>Also, I really want to journal my daily experience to see how far I change throughout the program. Just the process alone to get here was intense. I don't think I've really pushed myself as hard as I did during the application process for Ada. I spent a lot of time editing essays and code solutions to ensure that what I had was super tight, authentic and the best it could be. But I somehow found time to play some animal crossing! </p>

        <h1>I got in!</h1>
        <p>
          I got into the Ada Developers Academy! It’s unreal. I look back at the fear at the mistakes I thought I made throughout the process and it all feels insignificant now. I thought I said the wrong words or I thought I could have explained certain concepts better. I'm still practicing to not be too hard on myself.</p>

          <p>I’m unbelievable excited for the days ahead! I think I can do it!</p>
