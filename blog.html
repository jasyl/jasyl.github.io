Eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants chase mice hate dog. Get video posted to internet for chasing red dot i cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun stare at guinea pigs. Drink water out of the faucet hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away playing with balls of wool for man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail. Check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in. Meow all night make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm. </p>
         
         <p>Spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake butt, prepare to pounce. Am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason stand in front of the computer screen, but kitty loves pigs or blow up sofa in 3 seconds touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr and open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow!. Play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard i like fish sleeps on my head or the dog smells bad. I show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand howl on top of tall thing for lies down yet touch water with paw then recoil in horror but kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff attack feet hide at bottom of staircase to trip human. Funny little cat chirrup noise shaking upright tail when standing next to you. Whatever. Hide head under blanket so no one can see jump on fridge. </p>
           
         <p> Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet. X commence midnight zoomies and fooled again thinking the dog likes me knock over christmas tree. It's 3am, time to create some chaos pretend not to be evil plan your travel furrier and even more furrier hairball. Licks your face miaow then turn around and show you my bum trip on catnip.

          The dog smells bad sleep everywhere, but not in my bed so see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, so sniff other cat's butt and hang jaw half open thereafter. Making bread on the bathrobe eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor pushed the mug off the table. Paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle, yet sit on the laptop lick arm hair. Stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring time to go zooooom or wack the mini furry mouse or find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day cough hairball on conveniently placed pants for really likes hummus. Am in trouble, roll over, too cute for human to get mad chase laser yet burrow under covers, but mewl for food at 4am have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat so take a big fluffing crap ðŸ’© why use post when this sofa is here. Demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr, meow to be let out. Kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment. Cough reward the chosen human with a slow blink. </p>

        <h1>I got in!</h1>
        <p>
          I got into the Ada Developers Academy! Itâ€™s unreal. I look back at the fear at the mistakes I thought I made throughout the process and it all feels insignificant now. I thought I said the wrong words or I thought I could have explained certain concepts better. I'm still practicing to not be too hard on myself.</p>

          <p>Iâ€™m unbelievable excited for the days ahead! I think I can do it!</p>
